          This project makes use of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
          API to display sighting occurances of endangered wildlife around the
          globe based on geographic coordinates. Wikipedia's API is used to display species summary information and a representative image of the species. MapBox's Api is used to display maps based on geographic coordinates and display layers of data from the GBIF global wildlife dataset.

          Information Facility—is an international network and data

          "GBIF—the Global Biodiversity Information Facility—is an international
          network and data infrastructure funded by the world's governments and
          aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to data about all
          types of life on Earth. Coordinated through its Secretariat in
          Copenhagen, the GBIF network of participating countries and
          organizations, working through participant nodes, provides
          data-holding institutions around the world with common standards, best
          practices and open-source tools enabling them to share information
          about where and when species have been recorded. This knowledge
          derives from many sources, including everything from museum specimens
          collected in the 18th and 19th century to geotagged smartphone photos
          shared by amateur naturalists in recent days and weeks. The GBIF
          network draws all these sources together through the use of data
          standards, including Darwin Core, which forms the basis for the bulk
          of GBIF.org's index of hundreds of millions of species occurrence
          records. Publishers provide open access to their datasets using
          machine-readable Creative Commons licence designations, allowing
          scientists, researchers and others to apply the data in hundreds of
          peer-reviewed publications and policy papers each year. Many of these
          analyses—which cover topics from the impacts of climate change and the
          spread of invasive and alien pests to priorities for conservation and
          protected areas, food security and human health— would not be possible
          without this."
